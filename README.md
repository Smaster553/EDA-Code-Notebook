# Analysis of Fatal Police Shootings

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is is to unveil patterns, trends, and potential disparities within these incidents through advanced data analysis techniques. 
By leveraging the power of data, we aim to contribute valuable insights that can inform discussions on law enforcement practices, social justice, and public safety.

## Project Description
The [sourced dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings/blob/master/v1/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv) used for the project is compiled by The Washington Post. 
Data visualization and predictive modeling techniques are used to analyze fatal police shootings incidents data from 2015 to 2022 in the United States. 
### Research Question
The central question guiding our investigation is: "How does the perceived level of threat impact the occurrence of police shootings throughout the United States?" In addressing this question, we utilize line charts and histograms to identify patterns and temporal trends.
### Predictive Modeling
To delve deeper into the dataset, predictive modeling techniques such as the Chi-squared test and Logistic Regression Modeling are employed. These techniques allow us to investigate potential relationships between variables, including  *age, gender, race, and weapon type*. The outcomes of these analyses provide a nuanced understanding of the factors influencing fatal police shootings.
### Limitations
More tests and modeling done from the police side can draw more insights. Expanding the analysis to incorporate more comprehensive data directly from the police side may offer a more holistic understanding of the dynamics surrounding fatal police shootings.
